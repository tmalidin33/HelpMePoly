This TP is weird.

Flag 1: You're supposed to use johntheripper. pwned account password is pwned2 iirc.
Flag 2: Log on windows machine with same password. Wait for the countdown and select bottom option.

You're supposed to show hidden files and modify the batch file on the C: drive to change user for flag 3 but I didn't succeed. You can use the SAM password erasure from  from a previous TP if you want to cheat your way to flag 3.
